Assassin Mode

Each player is secretly assigned a target at the start of the game. The first player to eliminate their target wins immediately!

Your target is shown in the Mod menu and in a popup when you first join the game. Targets are assigned in a circular pattern to ensure everyone has exactly one target and is someone else's target.

The game ends immediately when a player successfully eliminates their assigned target - all other players' territories are transferred to neutral, declaring the assassin the winner.

Compatible with any map and most game settings. Best played with 4+ players for maximum intrigue!
